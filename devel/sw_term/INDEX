Calculation of the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert term.

check1        Allocation, assignment and inversion of the global SW arrays.

check2        Check of the gauge covariance of the SW term.

check3        Check of the SW term for Abelian background fields.

time1         Timing of the program sw_term().

All programs accept the options -bc <type> and -sw <type> that allow the type
of the boundary conditions and the SW term to be chosen. The default choices
(open boundary conditions, traditional SW term) apply if the options are not
set.
