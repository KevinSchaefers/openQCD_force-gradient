Computation of the topological charge and the Yang-Mills action.

check1         Check of the translation and gauge invariance of tcharge().

check2         Topological charge of constant Abelian background fields.

check3         Check of the programs tcharge_slices() and tcharge_fld().

check4         Check of the translation and gauge invariance of ym_action().

check5         Yang-Mills action of constant Abelian background fields.

check6         Check of the programs ym_action_slices() and ym_action_fld().

All programs accept the option -bc <type> that allows the type of boundary
condition to be chosen. When the option is not set, open boundary conditions
are assumed.
