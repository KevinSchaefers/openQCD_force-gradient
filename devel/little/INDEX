Little Dirac operator

check1        Direct checks of Aw_dble() and Aw().

check2        Consistency checks on Aw_dble(),..,Awhat().

check3        Check of the program set_ltl_modes().

time1         Timing of Awhat().

time2         Timing of set_Awhat().

All programs accept the options -bc <type> and -sw <type> that allow the type
of the boundary conditions and the SW term to be chosen. The default choices
(open boundary conditions, traditional SW term) apply if the options are not
set.
