Basic utility programs for complex fields

check1        Allocation and initialization of the global vector fields.

check2        Check of the programs in the module vinit.c.

check3        Check of the communication program cpv_int_bnd().

check4        Check of the communication program cpvd_int_bnd().

The programs check3 and check4 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the
type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not
set, open boundary conditions are assumed.

The option may be set but has no effect in the case of check1 and check2.
