Saving/restoring field configurations to/from files.

check1        Writing and reading of gauge, momentum and spinor fields.

check2        Exporting and importing gauge, momentum and spinor fields.

check3        Block-exporting and importing gauge, momentum and spinor fields.

check4        Importing a previously exported gauge-field configuration
              (possibly with anti-periodic/periodic extension).

check5        Block-importing a previously block-exported gauge-field
              configuration (possibly with anti-periodic/periodic extension).

See main/README.io for a description of the different configuration storage
types. The configuration directory structure assumed by the check programs
is the one described in README.iodat.

The programs check1,..,check5 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the
type of boundary condition to be chosen (open boundary conditions are assumed
if the option is not set). The programs check4 and check5 additionally accept
the option -mask <int>, which permits to set the periodic-extension mask and
the option -rmold that implies the removal of the saved gauge fields.

On exit the program check1 deletes the saved fields, check2 and check3 too
except for the gauge-field configuration, which may subsequently be read by
check4 and check5,respectively.
