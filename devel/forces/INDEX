MD force programs.

check1        Gauge and translation invariance of the gauge action.

check2        Gauge action of constant Abelian fields.

check3        Check of force0() and action0().

check4        Check of sw_frc() and hop_frc().

check5        Check and performance of the CG solver.

check6        Check of force1() and action1().

check7        Check of force2() and action2().

check8        Check and performance of the multi-shift CG solver.

check9        Check of force3() and action3().

check10       Check of force4() and action4().

check11       Check of force5() and action5().

check12       Check of the numerical accuracy of the calculated actions
              and forces.

time1         Timing of plaq_frc(), sw_frc() and hop_frc().

Except for check5, check8 and check12, all programs accept the option -bc
<type> that allows the type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime.
When the option is not set, open boundary conditions are assumed.

The programs check4,check6,check7,check9,check10,check11 and time1 moreover
accept the option -sw <type>, which selects the type of the SW term at runtime
(0 corresponds to the traditional SW term and 1 to the "exponential" variant).
The default type is 0.

In the case of the programs check5, check8 and check12, the boundary
conditions and the type of the SW term are selected through the input
parameter file.

The programs check5 and check8 require as input an ensemble of gauge
configurations as produced by the programs main/{qcd1.c,qcd2.c,ym1.c,ym2.c}.

The program check12 requires as input an ensemble of gauge configurations
together with the corresponding pseudo-fermion fields as produced by the
program main/qcd2.c. Typically the latter is run for some time and the check
program is then called, with the same action, force and solver parameters, in
order to check the numerical accuracy of the calculated actions and forces.
