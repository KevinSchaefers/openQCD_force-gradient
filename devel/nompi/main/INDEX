Simple analysis programs for data files produced by the programs in the
directory "main".

read1         Reads and evaluates the data on the data files <name>.dat
              produced by the simulation programs qcd1, qcd2, ym1 and ym2.

read2         Reads and evaluates the data on the data files <name>.ms1.dat
              produced by the reweighting-factor measurement program ms1.

The path of the data file to be analysed must be specified on the command
line like read1 $HOME/dat/goofy.dat, for example.
