Checking a no-MPI function that should also be usable in MPI programs requires
a replacement for the basic utility functions. The associated modules and
include files are found in the modules/nompi and include/nompi directories.

Currently the directories with the check programs are

dft              Discrete Fourier transform.

extras           Modified Bessel function.

forces           Generic functions for MD force calculations.

linalg           Generic complex matrix operations.

main             Simple analysis programs for the data files produced by
                 the programs in the directory main.

random           Random number generator.

ratfcts          Rational approximations.

su3fcts          SU(3) exponential function and SU(3) products.

sw_term          Pauli matrix operations.

utils            Byte swapping.
