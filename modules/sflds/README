Pbnd.c          Generic programs for the projector theta to the exterior
                boundary of a block of lattice points (version for single-
                precision fields).

Pbnd_dble.c     Generic programs for the projector theta to the exterior
                boundary of a block of lattice points (version for double-
                precision fields).

scom.c          Communication functions for single-precision spinor fields.

sdcom.c         Communication functions for double-precision spinor fields.

sflds.c         Initialization and assignment programs.

unorm.c         Programs related to the uniform norm of spinor fields.
